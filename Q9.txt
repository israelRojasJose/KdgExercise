Question: What improvements would you
make to the object model to
improve your overall workflow
without impacting the structure in
the json?


Answer: 
To enhance the overall workflow of the existing object model without making any changes to its fundamental structure, I would consider several improvements.
First, focusing on implementing a more direct use of key values within the object model, allowing for faster data retrieval through index access.
Work on defining stronger data types to improve data validation. Currently, many of the models provide arrays of various data types, which can be quite vague. 
Taking the time to carefully map object properties to the model would provide a more structured and validated approach.
While it's currently easy to retrieve data by calling specific functions, I've noticed a significant gap in the system: the absence of robust data validation. This is a crucial missing piece that I need to address.
Additionally, I recommend making corrections in our error handling. At some point, unexpected issues may arise, and our program may not be adequately prepared to handle them.
In conclusion, I recognize the strengths of Object-Oriented Programming, implementing its advantages more effectively would make the workflow smoother.
